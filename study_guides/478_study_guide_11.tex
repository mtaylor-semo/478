\section{Concepts}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the ``stochastic-deterministic debate''? How does this relate to diversity of coral reef fishes?

	\item What is recruitment?
	
	\item Based on the assigned reading from your text and Figure 24.9, explain how pre-recruitment and post-recruitment processes may contribute to the assemblage of coral reef fishes.
	
	\item Explain each of the four specific hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the structure of reef communities.  Which (separately or in combination) do you think is the most likely explanation?  Justify your answer.

	\item Briefly describe each of the general observations about reef fish communities that were considered as the above hypotheses were developed.
	
	\item Which of the four hypotheses we discussed in class could be considered pre-recruitment processes? Which hypotheses could be considered post-recruitment processes?
	
	\item Which of the four hypotheses we discussed in class could be considered stochastic?  Which could be considered deterministic?
	
	\item What is the priority effect? How does it affect larval recruitment? How does the priority effect fit into the ``stochastic-deterministic'' continuum?
	
\end{enumerate}
