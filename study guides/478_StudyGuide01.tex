\section{Using the Study Guides}
The\marginnote{The pages to study listed in the study guides are required reading and fair game for exams.\\ \textbf{Study:} Pgs. 3--9, 15--16.} study guides will help you learn the material.  Each study guide contains vocabulary to learn and a series of questions based on the lectures and the assigned reading from the textbook.  The guides may also contain information to supplement the lecture.  Read the study guides in advance of lecture to get familiar with the day's topic. Bring the study guide to class to see the vocabulary and questions in context of the lecture discussion.  This will help you recall the information during your regular study. I will not collect your answers to study guide questions.

\section{Vocabulary}
The vocabulary lists terms from each lecture that you learn and be able to apply in a broader context.  I will use the terms in lectures and on exams. If you do not know the terms, you may not understand the lecture or be able to answer an exam question. I expect you to use the proper vocabulary in your answers to questions on exams and assignments.  Use the terms as you learn the material.  I may not cover all terms in class or do so only in passing.  I expect that you will learn them by reading your textbook and using the terms in the context of the course material.

\section{Concepts}

You should \emph{write} clear and concise answers to each question in this section.  The questions are not necessarily independent.  Think broadly across lectures to see ``the big picture.''  Study guide questions may be used as a basis for short answer or essay exam questions. I may also write exam and assignment questions that do not appear on the study guides. These are guides, not exhaustive test banks.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Know the proper suffixes for order, suborder, and family.

	\item What are the five classes that comprise living “fishes”?\sidenote{Table 1.1 of your text gives a slightly different classification scheme. Recent molecular evidence supports the arrangement I presented in lecture. You will later learn other classes of fishes that have only fossil representatives.}

	\item Know approximately the number of orders, families, genera and species of fishes, world-wide.

	\item Explain the proper usage of the terms “fish” and fishes.”

\end{enumerate}
