If you'd like to do a cool fish experiment, might I suggest a study of schooling behavior. Get 2 10 gallon tanks, and some zebrafish (danios). zebrafish are extremely hardy. Examine what happens when a "predator" is introduced to the environment, i.e. does the school compact or disperse, does the school try to attack the predator as a group, or do they hide in a corner. Your variable can be size of school. so, get two tanks around 10 gallons, and around 20 fish. At first, use schools of five fish, then schools of ten, schools of twenty. Do this about three times with each school, The other tank will be used to hold the other extra fish. you don't need much decor, and you would only need a filter that is cheap but clean. This would be an interesting look at behavioral ecology. And something that I am working on right now.
